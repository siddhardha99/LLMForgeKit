# LLMForgeKit

LLMForgeKit is a comprehensive toolkit for building sophisticated AI applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides a unified framework that abstracts the complexities of working with various LLM providers and tools, enabling developers to create robust, modular, and intelligent systems.

## Core Components

LLMForgeKit implements the Cognitive Orchestration Layer (COL) architecture with four key components:

1. **Dynamic Prompt Fabric**: Advanced prompt management system that enables versioning, dynamic generation, and context-aware optimization of prompts.

2. **Intelligent Semantic Aligner**: Output parsing and validation system that converts raw LLM responses into structured, actionable data with confidence scoring.

3. **Adaptive Agentic Choreographer**: Sophisticated workflow engine that orchestrates multi-step processes with agent-based execution and dynamic planning.

4. **Universal Capability Fabric**: (Coming soon) Standardized tool integration system that provides a consistent interface for external capabilities.

## Features

- **Flexible Provider Integration**: Works with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Robust Error Handling**: Built-in retry logic, rate limit handling, and error recovery
- **Modular Design**: Extensible architecture allowing custom components
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and performance tracking
- **Adaptive Processing**: Intelligent workflows that can respond to changing conditions
- **Agent-Based Operations**: Specialized agents that can perform complex tasks

## Use Cases

- Question answering systems with multi-step reasoning
- Autonomous agents that can plan and execute tasks
- Content generation workflows with quality control
- Data extraction and analysis pipelines
- Multi-modal AI applications combining text, images, and structured data
